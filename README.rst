Spell checker for code
======================
This is a Python library and tool to check for misspelled words in
source code. It does this by looking for words from a list of
common misspellings. The dictionary it uses to do this is based
on the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines

The list has been slightly modified to remove some changes that
cause a number of false positives. In particular ``ok->OK`` was
removed (ok is frequently used in perl tests for instance).

Example
=======
To try it out, merely run the following (using an old coreutils
source tree as an example)::

    $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils -b v8.10 coreutils
    $ find coreutils -name '*.c' | misspellings -f -
    coreutils/src/cat.c:754: efficency -> "efficiency"
    coreutils/src/comm.c:198: funtion -> "function"
    coreutils/src/expr.c:21: seperate -> "separate"
    coreutils/src/pr.c:1417: accomodate -> "accommodate"
    coreutils/src/tac.c:342: unneccessary -> "unnecessary"
    coreutils/src/test.c:91: supressed -> "suppressed"

Contributions
=============
Contributions are welcome! Please add unit tests for new features
or bug fixes. To run all the unit tests run ``./setup.py test``.
If you have `tox`_ installed, just run ``tox``.

You can review `coverage`_ of added tests by running
``coverage run setup.py test`` and then running
``coverage report -m``.

Note that tests are run on `Travis`_ for all supported python
versions whenever the tree on github is pushed to.

The packaged version is available via ``pip`` or ``easy_install``
as ``misspellings``. The project page is on `pypi`_:

The source code is available in the following locations:

- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/lyda/misspell-check/src
- code.google: http://code.google.com/p/misspell-check/
- Github: https://github.com/lyda/misspell-check
- Gitorious: https://gitorious.org/uu/misspell-check
- Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/p/misspell-check

Pull requests on any of those platforms or emailed patches are fine.

TODO
====
Some items on the TODO list:

* Implement option to interactively fix files.
* Give some thought to supporting multiple languages?
* Might a "common misspellings" list be different for different English
  users - might an American make one set of mistakes while a German
  writing English make another? Source of this data?
* Fix sed flag.  Have it support sed -i optionally, have it output all
  unambiguous sed commands, have it be more careful on what it
  replaces. It might also be an idea to have a perl output option.
* Use generators to allow finding errors as you go. Currently misspellings
  grabs all files first, then checks them, which can take a while.
* Lacking tests for misspellings cli.
* Support UTF8: https://github.com/lyda/misspell-check/issues/16
